It allowed me to explore a variety of ICT innovations, expanding my understanding of technology's role in education.

<p align="left">Certainly, there is one improvement that can enhance this visit. Presenters should use microphones for clearer explanations, and soundproof walls between booths are necessary, particularly in a crowded venue. This ensures that we can hear the presenters effectively amid the numerous booths and people. Another effective measure is to space the booths farther apart to ease congestion caused by the high interest of many people wanting to explore innovations at each booth.</p>
